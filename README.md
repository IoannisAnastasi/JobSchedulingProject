Basic idea: there are 2 separate programs (so 2 different main methods). OrderGenerator creates the random orders and places them in the text file. 
OrderDelivery calculates the order completion time based on set parameters and 3 different time scheduling algorithms and it outputs the results in a different text file. A report can then be created.
